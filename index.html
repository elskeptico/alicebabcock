                <p>Alice S. Babcock, a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, teacher, and friend, passed away peacefully on September 21, 2025, surrounded by her loving family. She was 79 years old. <br>
Born on March 9, 1946, Alice grew up with a love for ice skating. In her youth, she nearly joined the Ice Capades and even skated alongside the famed Peggy Fleming. That same passion and determination carried into the many chapters of her life. <br> <br>
Alice graduated from San Jose State University and dedicated her career to teaching. For decades, she shared her love of learning with countless children in public schools across San Jose and Gilroy - most often guiding 4th-grade students who were recent arrivals to the United States. Her compassion and patience helped shape young lives and create lasting connections with her students and their families. <br> <br>
A devoted mother, Alice lovingly raised her three children - Rebecca, Elizabeth, and Dale Catherine - on her own.  Every evening, she made a home-cooked dinner after a long day of teaching and sometimes holding two jobs. Once her children were grown, she found new joy in marriage to her husband, Ray Babcock. <br> <br>
Alice embraced many interests throughout her life. She enjoyed reading, daily walks, water skiing, and tennis. She loved to travel and collected souvenir spoons from every place she visited, each one marking a memory and adventure. Her faith was central to her life - she loved Jesus and was deeply involved in her church community. Alice was also dedicated to helping others, delivering Meals on Wheels and volunteering her time at the San Jose Rescue Mission. <br> <br>
Known for her kindness, empathy, and unwavering willingness to listen, Alice was the kind of friend who could sit with someone for hours, offering understanding and encouragement. Her light touched everyone she met. <br> <br>
Alice is survived by her husband, Ray; her three children, Rebecca, Elizabeth, and Dale Catherine; her stepdaughter Suzzane; ten grandchildren; two step-grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. Her love and legacy will live on through them and the many lives she inspired. <br> <br>
Alice will be remembered for her boundless warmth, her gentle strength, and her steadfast faith. <br> <br>
